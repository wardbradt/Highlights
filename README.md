Highlights wass an in-development social network created by [Ward Bradt](https://github.com/wardbradt), [Sam Xifaras](https://github.com/sam-xif), Michael Ren, and [Malcolm Essaid](https://github.com/malcolmessaid).

The code written on the first day of development, at [HackNEHS](https://www.hacknehs.com/) 2017, is open-source. However, code developed afterwards is proprietary.
